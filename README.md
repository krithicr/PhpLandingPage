## Getting Started

To get the EcoTech Home Energy Audit website up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Configure a Web Server**: You'll need a web server with PHP support to host this website. Here's how to do it using 000webhost:

   - **Sign Up for 000webhost**: If you haven't already, sign up for a free account at [https://www.000webhost.com/](https://www.000webhost.com/).

   - **Create a Website**: After signing in to your 000webhost account, create a new website by following their website creation process. This will include selecting a subdomain (e.g., `yourwebsite.000webhostapp.com`) or connecting your own domain.

2. **Upload Files**: Once you've created your website on 000webhost, you need to upload the repository files. Here's how:

   - **Access the File Manager**: Inside your 000webhost account, navigate to the file manager or file upload section.

   - **Upload the Files**: Upload the entire repository folder into the appropriate directory. If you're using a subdomain like `yourwebsite.000webhostapp.com`, the default directory may be something like `public_html`. Upload the contents of the repository into this directory.

3. **Access the Website**: After uploading the files, you can access the website by opening a web browser and entering your domain name or the subdomain provided by 000webhost in the web browser's address bar. Here's an example:

   - **Example Subdomain**: If you used a subdomain like `yourwebsite.000webhostapp.com`, you can access the website by entering `http://yourwebsite.000webhostapp.com`.

   - **Custom Domain**: If you connected your own domain, enter your domain name in the web browser's address bar (e.g., `http://www.yourdomain.com`) to access the website.
