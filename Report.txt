Title: Creating a Secure and User-Friendly PHP Web Form

Introduction:

  In building a PHP web form for the EcoTech Home Energy Audit website, I prioritized functionality and security. This report shares my approach, challenges, and key lessons.

Approach:
  1. Data Security: I used PHP functions like `filter_var` and regex for input validation and created a `sanitizeInput` function for sanitization, defending against SQL injection and XSS attacks.

  2. User-Friendly Error Handling: Clear error messages, linked to specific input fields, aided users in rectifying mistakes.

  3. Balanced Validation: Combining client-side for user convenience and server-side validation for security ensured robust data checks.

  4. Form Submission: Redirection to a "Thank You" page prevented duplicates, enhancing user experience.

Challenges:
  1. Security vs. Convenience: Balancing security with user ease required meticulous validation and testing.

  2. JavaScript Integration: Aligning JavaScript and server-side PHP validation, especially error handling, was complex.

Key Takeaways:
  1. Security Priority: Rigorous input validation, server-side checks, and data sanitization are vital for data security.

  2. User-Centric Feedback: Clear error messages improve user experience.

In conclusion, building a secure and user-friendly PHP web form for EcoTech was instructive, emphasizing code clarity and security for future projects.
